Objective
=========

PyCon is a conference where Python users can meet and talk about the
developments around Python and the Python community.  All Pythonistas in the
region get together to know more about various domains and meet people with
diverse experience.

In 2013 we will host the 4th annual PyCon Asia Pacific (APAC). The first three
events were hosted in Singapore, and it is our honor to host this year's event
for the first time in Japan.

" **The Year of Python** " will be the theme for PyCon APAC 2013. The PyCon JP
team is organizing this year's PyCon APAC but we will strive to provide
interactive sessions where everyone can meet up with each other just as we had
in previous PyCon JP events. With the expanding scope to the usual PyCon JP, we
are also inviting more international spearkers and adding additional English
sessions to provide a true region-wide conference experience.

We are also glad to announce that we are arranging tutorial sessions with
some charge.  We'll post updates once we confirm the details.
