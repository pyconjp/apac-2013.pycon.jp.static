Development sprints are a key part of PyCon JP, a chance for the contributors to open-source projects to get together face-to-face for up to four days of intensive learning, development and camaraderie. Newbies sit with gurus, go out for lunch and dinner together, and have a great time while advancing their project.

What's a sprint?
================
PyCon JP Development Sprints are one day of intensive learning and development on an open source project of your choice, in a team environment. It's a time to come together with colleagues, old and new, to share what you've learned and apply it to an open source project.

In the crucible of a sprint room, teaming with both focus and humor, it's a time to test, fix bugs, add new features, and improve documentation. And it's a time to network, make friends, and build relationships that go beyond the conference.

PyCon provides the space and infrastructure (network, power, tables & chairs); you bring your skills, humanity, and brainpower (oh! and don't forget your computer).

Who can participate?
--------------------

You!

All experience levels are welcome; sprints are a great opportunity to get connected with, and start contributing to your favorite Python project.

Participation for Sprint is free!
Please just bring your laptop for development. There will be Wifi available.

To join Sprint, please sign up from the Connpass site http://connpass.com/event/3403/ . If you would like to propose your own theme, you can register as a Sprint Leader. You may also register as a Sprint Attendee to join themes proposed by other Leaders.
