The call for talk proposals for PyCon APAC 2013 is now open!

We are seeking proposals for talks for this year's PyCon APAC. Is there a talk you want to give on a topic that interests you? Do you want to introduce the community to a library or useful piece of Python software? If so then submit your proposal now!

Since we are holding PyCon APAC, which is a conference for the entire Asia-Pacific region, we are expecting many international participants. Therefore, we are seeking a large number of English talk proposals. This is your chance to introduce your topic to Pythonistas in Asia!
