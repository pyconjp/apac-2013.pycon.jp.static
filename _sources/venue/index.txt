Special Requirements
------------------------------

Dietary requirements are not common among Japanese, and dietary requirements
such as vegan, or muslim halal are not well understood. It is adviseable to
bring a list of what you can and cannot eat with pictures if you would like to
venture into local Japanese restaurants (e.g. if you consume dairy products
when you are vegetarian)

Here are some vegetarian and halal friendly restaurants.

* `Vegetarian <http://www.vegguide.org/region/364>`_

Weather
==============================

The weather in Japan in September is warm and humid with the average daytime
temperature being 27 C (81 F) and the average nighttime low being 21 C (70 F).
August and September is peak Typhoon season so you may want to have an umbrella
and catch up on the local weather report before traveling.
